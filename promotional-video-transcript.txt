Bitcoin, like other decentralised cryptocurrencies, has inherent scalability issues. One prominent solution to that is
the Lightning Network which allows users to exchange funds off-chain, with minimal latency. Unfortunately, every
Lightning user has to periodically sync with the blockchain to ensure her counterparty hasn't committed fraud and punish
him if he has. To relax this requirement, there exist services known as watchtowers to which Lightning users can
delegate watching the blockchain. In their current form, watchtowers are only paid when fraud is attempted, which is the
very thing they are trying to protect against. This leads to misaligned incentives for watchtowers and lack of a Nash
Equilibrium.

In our work we propose an alternative watchtower construction and we prove its incentive compatibility. A watchtower can
now be paid periodically, ensuring predictable profitability. To achieve this, the watchtower must lock some funds as
collateral, which is confiscated by its client only in case of fraud.

For more details come listen to our TPBC talk on June 17.
