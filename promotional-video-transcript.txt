Bitcoin, like other decentralised blockchains, has inherent scalability issues. One solution is Lightning which allows
users to exchange funds off-chain with minimal latency. Unfortunately, every Lightning user has to periodically sync
with the blockchain to ensure her counterparty hasn't committed fraud and punish him if he has. To relax this
requirement, there exist services known as watchtowers to which Lightning users can delegate watching the blockchain.
Currently watchtowers are only paid when fraud is attempted, which is the very thing they are trying to protect against.
This leads to misaligned incentives and lack of a Nash Equilibrium.

In our work we propose an alternative watchtower construction and we prove its incentive compatibility. A watchtower can
now be paid periodically, ensuring predictable profitability. To achieve this, the watchtower must lock some funds as
collateral, which is confiscated by its client only in case of fraud.

For more details come listen to our TPBC talk on June 17.
