% A few stylistic standards used in these bib entries,
% designed for brevity without sacrificing essential completeness
% (most entries fit on two lines in footnotesize):
% - Short and long conference titles including conference numbers:
%	e.g., \bibconf[17th]{SOSP}{ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles}
% - Use "and others" for papers with more than three or four authors
% - No publisher for conference proceedings; conference name is enough.
